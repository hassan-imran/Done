************
Ignore the UI as it was not the main focus while coding on this project, it is not completely responsive, however I have tried my best to make it look reasonable.

## Default users

admin ---Username

Admin123 ---Password


guest ---UserName

Guest123 ---Password


Although you can sign up too! (no details required, just a user ID and a password, which is also only stored in your localStorage because there is no database at the back!)

***********************************************

The program uses localStorage to verify accounts before logging in as a security feature.

It also uses the same method to pass information between pages

*********

If you refresh the page the new accounts or any reminder data will be lost.

However if you do not refresh the page the account data and the reminders will be there even if you login from different accounts.
